# CouchTV

Couch TV is a Couch Potato client for tvOS. It is not possible to use it on Apple TV as there is no web browser.

## What features are there?

For now, here's what you can do:
- Discover: Section contains Suggestions and Charts
- Search: Search a movie by name (dictation is crashing the app)
- Settings: Define CouchPotato URL and APIKey
- Add movie: After selecting a movie from Discover or Search you can add it to your Couch Potato

## That's it?

Yes, I focused mainly on having a way to add or discover movies. Managing your library, selecting a profile or source will come at a later time.

## What's in your backlog?

I invite you to visit the Issues sections, but here's a few:
- Manage (delete, force-refresh) Wanted and Available movies
- Allow playing trailer in movie screen
- Optimise Discover screen (currently it is a bit slow if you scroll too fast in the first time)
- Implement a function to retrieve the API Key (in Settings)
- Have a proper placeholder when loading images

## FAQ

Thank you kind sir!
However, the big work is not mine! I'll tell you to donate to CouchPotato instead at https://couchpota.to/#support. 

### Are you proud of this?
Well... Can't say I'm not. I started this to learn Swift and programming for tvOS. Of course there are bugs, code isn't the pretiest for sure but, as an overall, I'm happy!

### Your unit tests make no sense!
I believe you! I'm learning how to write unit tests on my own, sadly.
